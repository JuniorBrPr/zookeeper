# Zookeeper

##Description
The zookeeper game is a Java program that allows a zookeeper to look at the animals in a virtual 
zoo. The zookeeper would enter the corresponding habitat number to look at the animals.

There are a few known issues with the program. The search function may not always return accurate results, and the 
program may crash if the user inputs an invalid option or provides incorrect input when trying to look at an animal.
